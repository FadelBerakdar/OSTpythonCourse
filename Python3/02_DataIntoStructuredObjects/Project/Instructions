create a file named coconuts.py, with an inventory class that tracks different
types of coconuts from around the world. The different types of coconuts must
have these weight attribute values:

    Type        |       Weight
South Asian     |         3
Middle Eastern  |        2.5
American        |        3.5

The inventory class must have the following methods:
•	add_coconut() accepts a coconut as an argument. Other types throw an AttributeError.
•	total_weight() provides the total weight of coconuts.

For this project, you may find the isinstance built-in useful.
You must Include a test_coconuts.py program to confirm all the Inventory class
methods. The tests must check:
1.	That different coconut types each have a different weight.
2.	That if a string object is passed to the Inventory.add_coconut method, an AttributeError is thrown.
3.	That if 2 South Asian, 1 Middle Eastern, and 3 American coconuts are added to the inventory, the Inventory.total_weight() method returns 19.
When they are working, submit coconuts.py and test_coconuts.py.
