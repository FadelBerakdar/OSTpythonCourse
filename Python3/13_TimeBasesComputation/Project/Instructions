create a program named mathquiz.py. In this program, you will create a math quiz.
This quiz will ask the user five addition questions adding random integers
between 1 and 10 inclusive.
Each answer will be timed so you can generate the following time results:
•	Time for each question
•	Total time for all questions
•	Average time per question

This program needs to generate random numbers using Python's random library.
Your project should meet the following conditions:
You must include a working test_mathquiz.py unittest file that tests at least
one function. Each time the test runs, it must present random integers.
Your code must generate output that looks like this:

What is the sum of 6 and 6? 1212 is right!
What is the sum of 5 and 4? 99 is right!
What is the sum of 4 and 2? 66 is right!
What is the sum of 1 and 1? 22 is right!
What is the sum of 9 and 2? 111111 is wrong!

Question #1 took about 1 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #2 took about 1 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #3 took about 1 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #4 took about 2 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #5 took about 2 seconds to complete and was wrong.

You took 9 seconds to finish the quiz
Your average time was 1.8 seconds per question
