Dear Fadel,

The time difference should not matter as you and I do not need to be on-line at
the sametime.  However from Kuala Lumper I can imagine the remote desktop
connection itself might be slow.  If it's terribly slow with keystroke delays
making Eclipse difficult to use, let me know.
Some students use ssh to access there sandbox.  Even so, some use of Eclipse is
 needed to complete the work.

Your function should test itself whether a and b are both int type, and if not,
 raise TypeError explicitly i.e. the function should "blow the whistle"
and raise the exception, if either input is not an int.  As currently written,
inputs of 2.0 and 3.0 would add to 5.0 no problem, but both inputs
are floats, so a TypeError should be raised.

The tests I most want to see involve assertRaises and look like this:

    self.assertRaises(TypeError, supper_adder, 1.0, 2.0)

With assertRaises, the callable object (supper_adder) is simply named,
no parentheses, no calling.  Then,
everything after that is an argument to that name.  I expect a TypeError
above because neither 1.0 nor 2.0
are ints.

assertRaises is often misunderstood at first.  This part of Python may be
confusing, so no worries you get
to work at this some more.  Thank you for introducing yourself.  I look forward
to working with you.
