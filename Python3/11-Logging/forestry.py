"""

The basic API for a Tree is pretty simple. You create it by calling Tree(s)
wheres is a size codeâ€”one of "S," "M," "L," "XL," or "XXL".

Instances have a get_boards() method that you call to learn the number of boards
the tree can produce (1 for a size "S" tree, 5 for a size "XXL").
Trees represent themselves as "Tree: Size S" or similar.

The Lumberjack is not that much more complicated in its initial implementation.
Created by calling the class Lumberjack(), each instance starts out with no tree
Once a tree is assigned it can be cut down and converted into boards by calling
the Lumberjack's cut_down_tree() method. If this method is called when the
Lumberjack has no tree, a TypeError exception is raised.
